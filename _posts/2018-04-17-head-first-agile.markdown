It is good read to know about the basics of Agile. I have been following this practices for sometime without knowing the name of it / thinking in detail about why that was there in the first place. This book answers that part.

It explained about Agile, Scrum practices, XP, Kanban. I felt my interest faded away when I read the last part which is Kanban methodology, but apart from that others are a good read. Motivated me to read about Extreme Programming Explained

Might be the way I see Agile projects would be different now.
